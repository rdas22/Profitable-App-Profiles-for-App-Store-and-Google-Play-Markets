    "# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "We're working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. Our aim is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App store and Google Play Markets. Our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users."

To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
